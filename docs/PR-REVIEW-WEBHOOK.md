# PR Review Webhook

Automated pull request code review via GitHub webhooks. When a PR is opened, updated, reopened, or marked ready for review, Codekin spawns a review session (Claude or OpenCode, configurable) that reviews the changes and posts findings directly to GitHub. When a PR is closed or merged, Codekin cleans up active sessions and manages the review cache.

## Overview

GitHub sends `pull_request` webhook events to Codekin. The handler filters by action, deduplicates, manages concurrency, creates an isolated workspace, and spawns a Claude session with the PR context and a review prompt.

## Architecture

### Event Flow

1. GitHub sends `pull_request` event (actions: `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `ready_for_review`, `closed`)
   _(For `closed` events, steps 2–12 are skipped — see [Closed/Merged Flow](#closedmerged-flow) below)_
2. `webhook-handler.ts` validates signature, filters by action/draft/allowlist
3. Dedup check (`webhook-dedup.ts`) — rejects already-processed events
4. Smart SHA filter — skips if the exact SHA was already reviewed. For `reopened`/`ready_for_review` this means no code change; for `opened`/`synchronize` it catches redeliveries after dedup TTL expiry.
5. Record in dedup and enter **debounce** (default 60s, configurable via `prDebounceMs`). Dedup is recorded early so GitHub retries during the debounce window are caught. If another event for the same PR arrives during the window, the older event is superseded and the timer restarts.
6. _Debounce timer fires_ — supersede any active session for the same PR (new push kills old review)
7. Concurrency cap check (configurable, default 3, set to 10 via `~/.codekin/webhook-config.json`)
8. Create isolated workspace via `webhook-workspace.ts` (bare mirror + worktree)
9. Fetch PR context in parallel: diff, changed files, commits, existing review comments, existing reviews, prior review cache, existing Codekin summary comment
10. Resolve review prompt: repo-level `.codekin/pr-review-prompt.md` > global `~/.codekin/pr-review-prompt.md` > built-in default
11. Spawn review session using the configured provider (Claude or OpenCode — see [Provider Selection](#provider-selection) below). Claude sessions use `allowedTools` and `--add-dir` for sandboxed tool access. OpenCode sessions get a workspace-local `opencode.json` with scoped permissions and `bypassPermissions` to auto-approve the remaining `ask`-default permissions.
12. Send assembled prompt (PR metadata + diff + existing reviews + prior cache context + comment update/create instructions + cache-writing instructions)

### Provider Selection

Reviews can be performed by Claude Code or OpenCode, configured via `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_PR_REVIEW_PROVIDER`:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `claude` (default) | All reviews use Claude |
| `opencode` | All reviews use OpenCode |
| `split` | **Random A/B sampling**: each review independently flips a 50/50 coin between Claude and OpenCode. Two consecutive reviews may land on the same provider — this is not alternation. The intent is unbiased sampling over many reviews to compare output quality between models. |

Per-provider model selection:
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_PR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_MODEL` (default: `sonnet`)
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_PR_REVIEW_OPENCODE_MODEL` (default: `openai/gpt-5.4`)

When `split` is active, the review comment footer (`*Reviewed by Claude (sonnet)*` or `*Reviewed by OpenCode (openai/gpt-5.4)*`) makes it obvious which provider ran that specific review.

### Debounce Persistence

Pending debounced events (accepted webhooks still waiting for their 60s timer) are persisted to `~/.codekin/webhook-pending-debounce.json` on shutdown and restored + fired immediately on the next startup. This prevents losing webhook events when Codekin restarts during the debounce window — since the events have already been 202'd to GitHub, GitHub will not retry.

### Closed/Merged Flow

When a PR is closed (`closed` action), the handler runs synchronously — no workspace or Claude session is needed:

1. Record the event in the event ring buffer for observability
2. Kill any active review sessions for the PR via `supersedePrSessions`
3. If **merged**: move cache file to `~/.codekin/pr-cache/{owner}/{repo}/archived/pr-{number}.json`
4. If **closed** (not merged): delete the cache file

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server/webhook-handler.ts` | Core dispatcher — `handlePullRequestEvent()` and `processPullRequestAsync()` |
| `server/webhook-pr-github.ts` | GitHub data fetching — diff, files, commits, review comments, reviews, existing Codekin comment |
| `server/webhook-pr-prompt.ts` | 3-tier prompt resolution and assembly, cache/comment instructions |
| `server/webhook-pr-cache.ts` | Per-PR context cache — `loadPrCache()`, `getCachePath()`, `ensureCacheDir()`, `archivePrCache()`, `deletePrCache()`, `PrCacheData` interface |
| `server/webhook-workspace.ts` | Bare mirror cloning + worktree creation with git auth |
| `server/webhook-dedup.ts` | Idempotency — split into `isDuplicate()` (check) and `recordProcessed()` (record) |
| `server/webhook-types.ts` | `PullRequestPayload` (includes `merged` field), `PullRequestContext`, `WebhookEventStatus` types |
| `server/webhook-config.ts` | Config loading from file + env vars |

### Session Lifecycle

- **Model**: Sonnet (configured in handler, not Opus — cost/speed tradeoff for reviews)
- **allowedTools**: `Bash(gh:*)`, `Write`, context7 MCP tools, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` (plus pre-approved file ops from `acceptEdits` mode)
- **addDirs**: The PR cache directory (`~/.codekin/pr-cache/{owner}/{repo}/`) is passed via `addDirs` through session creation to `ClaudeProcess`, which adds it via `--add-dir` so Claude can write cache files inside the sandbox.
- **No auto-restore**: Webhook sessions are one-shot. They are NOT restored on server restart (unlike user sessions). This prevents finished reviews from consuming concurrency slots.
- **Superseding**: When a new push arrives for the same PR, any active review session is marked `superseded` and deleted before the new one starts. Race condition guards check superseded status before workspace creation and session creation.

### Git Authentication

Workspace creation uses `gh repo clone` (handles auth internally), but subsequent `git fetch` commands need explicit credential configuration. Solved with per-process environment variables:

```typescript
const GIT_AUTH_ENV = {
  ...process.env,
  GIT_CONFIG_COUNT: '1',
  GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0: 'credential.https://github.com.helper',
  GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0: '!/usr/bin/gh auth git-credential',
}
```

Applied to bare mirror fetch and workspace fetch commands. Does NOT use `gh auth setup-git` (breaks other operations) or SSH (changes Codekin's design).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set in `~/.config/codekin/env` (loaded by systemd service, or source manually):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` | Yes | Set to `true` to enable |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | Shared secret for signature verification |

### Config File

`~/.codekin/webhook-config.json`:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrentSessions": 10
}
```

### Review Prompt

3-tier resolution:
1. **Repo-level**: `.codekin/pr-review-prompt.md` in the PR's repository
2. **Global**: `~/.codekin/pr-review-prompt.md`
3. **Built-in default**: Hardcoded fallback

The global prompt (`~/.codekin/pr-review-prompt.md`) is configured with:
- Expert council pattern (2-4 reviewers selected by tech stack)
- Mandatory Codex cross-review step before posting
- Practical impact filter — findings must pass "would this actually cause a problem?"
- Signal over noise — no manufactured issues, no academic observations, no premature optimizations
- Security and scalability as first-class concerns alongside correctness
- Existing review comment awareness — no duplicate findings
- Never approve, only COMMENT or REQUEST_CHANGES

## PR Context Cache

Subsequent reviews of the same PR reuse prior context instead of starting from scratch.

### How It Works

Cache location: `~/.codekin/pr-cache/{owner}/{repo}/pr-{number}.json`

```json
{
  "prNumber": 42,
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "lastReviewedSha": "abc1234",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  "priorReviewSummary": "PR adds SSO authentication...",
  "codebaseContext": "Auth module at src/auth/, uses JWT tokens...",
  "reviewFindings": "Found null check issue in auth.ts line 42..."
}
```

**What gets re-fetched every time:** diff, files, commits, GitHub comments/reviews (cheap, change between pushes).

**What gets cached:** Claude's prior review summary, codebase familiarity notes, and specific findings.

### Cache Lifecycle

1. On first review: no cache exists, prompt has no "Prior Review Context" section.
2. At end of review: Claude writes the cache JSON via the `Write` tool (instructed in the prompt).
3. On subsequent reviews (`synchronize`/`reopened`): cache is loaded and included as a "Prior Review Context" section in the prompt, with a note that the current diff and comments are fresh.
4. Claude uses prior context for faster, more informed review while still reviewing the full current diff.
5. On PR **merged**: cache file is moved to `archived/` subdirectory (preserves review history).
6. On PR **closed** (not merged): cache file is deleted (no value in keeping abandoned PR context).

### Resilience

- Missing cache: silently skipped (first review, or Claude failed to write it).
- Malformed/incomplete JSON: logged as warning, treated as no cache.
- Stale cache after force-push: `lastReviewedSha` won't match, but cache is supplementary — the fresh diff is authoritative.
- Concurrent reviews: last writer wins (acceptable since it's the most recent review).

## Update Existing Summary Comment

Instead of posting a new summary comment for every review, Codekin finds and updates its existing comment. Inline code comments are still posted fresh.

### Marker

Every Codekin review summary comment starts with a hidden HTML marker:

```html
<!-- codekin-review -->
```

GitHub preserves HTML comments in issue comment bodies, so the marker is invisible to readers but detectable via API.

### How It Works

1. Before the review session starts, `fetchExistingReviewComment()` searches the PR's issue comments (via `gh api /repos/{repo}/issues/{prNumber}/comments --paginate`) for the marker.
2. If found: the comment ID is passed to Claude with PATCH instructions to update it.
3. If not found: Claude receives POST instructions to create a new comment.
4. Both paths include the marker requirement so future reviews can find the comment.

### Shell Escaping

To avoid shell escaping issues with review body content, Claude is instructed to write the comment body to a file within the workspace directory (`${workspacePath}/review-body.md`) and use `gh api ... -F body=@${workspacePath}/review-body.md` rather than passing the body inline via `-f body='...'`. The workspace path is used instead of `/tmp` because the Claude sandbox blocks writes to `/tmp`.

## Dedup Fix

The original `isDuplicate()` was check-and-record in one call. This meant events rejected by the concurrency cap were still recorded as "seen," making redelivery impossible. Now split into:

- `isDuplicate(deliveryId, idempotencyKey)` — check only, no side effects
- `recordProcessed(deliveryId, idempotencyKey)` — called after the event passes filters and dedup

**Note:** With debounce enabled, `recordProcessed()` is called when the event enters the debounce queue (before the timer fires). This prevents GitHub from retrying the delivery during the 60s debounce window. Server restarts during the window are handled by [Debounce Persistence](#debounce-persistence) — pending entries are written to disk on shutdown and restored on the next startup — so no events are dropped on a graceful restart.

## Testing

- `server/webhook-handler.test.ts` — 79 tests including PR events, debounce, debounce persistence across restarts, smart SHA filter, provider selection (claude/opencode/split), superseding, cache/comment integration, closed/merged handling
- `server/webhook-pr-github.test.ts` — 22 tests for all fetch functions (diff, files, commits, review comments, reviews, existing review comment detection)
- `server/webhook-pr-prompt.test.ts` — 26 tests including prompt resolution, prior context rendering, cache-writing instructions, comment update/create instructions
- `server/webhook-pr-cache.test.ts` — 15 tests for cache loading, path generation, validation, error handling, archive, and delete
- `server/webhook-dedup.test.ts` — 26 tests for dedup check/record split, TTL eviction, max entries, disk persistence

Run: `npm test`

## Operational Notes

### Starting the Server

```bash
cd ~/repos/codekin
npm run build
set -a; source ~/.config/codekin/env; set +a
stdbuf -oL -eL node server/dist/ws-server.js > /tmp/codekin.log 2>&1 &
```

### Clearing Dedup

Stop the server first (it flushes on shutdown), then:

```bash
echo '{"byDeliveryId":{},"byIdempotencyKey":{}}' > ~/.codekin/webhook-dedup.json
```

### Monitoring

```bash
tail -f /tmp/codekin.log | grep webhook
```

## Known Limitations

- **Codekin permission delegation**: The Claude CLI rejects tools not in `--allowedTools` before any hook fires. Codekin can't show approval prompts for these tools. Workaround: add needed tools to `allowedTools` at spawn time.
- **MCP tools in webhook sessions**: context7 tools must be in `allowedTools` to work. Added explicitly.
- **Codex cross-review**: Requires `codex` CLI installed. Uses input redirection (`< file`) not pipes (Codekin's bash doesn't support pipes).
